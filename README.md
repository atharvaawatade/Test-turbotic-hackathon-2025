# 🤖 RaiseIssue - AI-Powered GitHub Issue Triage Bot

> **Turbotic Hackathon 2025 Submission**

An intelligent automation that triages GitHub issues using AI, detects duplicates, auto-labels, and even fixes simple bugs automatically.

## 🎯 The Problem

Open source maintainers and dev teams waste **15-20 hours per week** manually triaging GitHub issues:
- ❌ Duplicate issues pile up
- ❌ Missing reproduction steps
- ❌ Issues without proper labels
- ❌ Simple bugs that could be auto-fixed
- ❌ Spam and low-quality reports

## ✨ The Solution

**IssueGPT** automatically:
1. **Analyzes** new issues with AI semantic understanding
2. **Detects** duplicates by comparing content (not just keywords)
3. **Labels** issues intelligently (bug/feature/docs/question)
4. **Responds** with helpful prompts for missing information
5. **Auto-fixes** simple issues like typos and documentation errors
6. **Reports** weekly insights on trending bugs and pain points

## 🚀 How It Works

```
New Issue Created → Turbotic Webhook Triggered → AI Analysis → Intelligent Action
```

### AI Analysis Engine
- Classifies issue type (bug, feature, docs, question, spam)
- Extracts technical details (errors, versions, stack traces)
- Rates completeness (1-10 score)
- Compares against recent issues for duplicates
- Suggests appropriate labels

### Intelligent Response System
- **Low completeness?** → Asks for reproduction steps
- **Likely duplicate?** → Links to similar issues
- **Well-formed bug?** → Auto-labels and thanks contributor
- **Simple fix needed?** → Creates PR automatically
- **Spam detected?** → Politely requests more details

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

1. **Create an issue** in this repo (any type - bug, feature, question)
2. **Watch the magic** - IssueGPT will analyze and respond within seconds
3. **See the intelligence** - Check the labels, comments, and suggestions

## 📝 Example Issues to Try

- **Bug Report:** "App crashes when I click the button"
- **Feature Request:** "Add dark mode support"
- **Question:** "How do I install this?"
- **Duplicate:** "The button doesn't work" (after submitting crash bug)
- **Typo Fix:** Point out a spelling error in docs

## 🎯 Turbotic Hackathon 2025
